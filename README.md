1.Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module5-solution or mod5_solution, etc.

2.You will need to download the starter files for this project and copy them into your solution container folder (e.g., into 'module5-solution'). Since assignments and starter code get updated from time to time, don't assume that you have the latest version already on your system. The best way to ensure that you are working with the very latest starter code is either 'git clone' the fullstack-course4 repository into a new directory OR, if you've already done 'git clone' previously, you can simply open up your command prompt (cmd on Windows or Terminal on Mac), navigate to the folder where the fullstack-course4 repository was previously cloned into and do: git pull

This will update your local repository with whatever changes have been made since the last update.

As a reminder, the full repository URL is: https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course4

3.Once you update your repository, copy all the contents of the fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment5/assignment5-solution-starter folder into your newly created solutions container folder for this assignment, e.g., module5-solution.

Once that's done, you are ready to start coding the solution.

NOTE: the provided code will not run. It is up to you to follow the instructions to get it to run.

4.You are NOT allowed to change the home-snippet.html file. Any adjustments to the value of randomCategoryShortName property needs to be done in Javascript code.

5.There are 4-5 fairly simple steps to implement the required functionality.

6.Open up js/script.js file.
Find TODO: STEP 0, and follow the instructions until you are done with TODO: STEP 4.

If you've watched the lectures, the code should be very familiar to you.

Once you are done, verify that the desired functionality is working correctly. Use Browser Sync or deploy your solution to GitHub pages.
Load the home page in the browser.
Click on the Specials tile. A single page category with a list of menu items for some category should appear.
Click on the restaurant logo to go back to the home page.
Click on the Specials tile again. Most likely, a different single page category page will be shown.

7.Repeat this several times to make sure that most of the time you see a different single category page.

8.That's it!
